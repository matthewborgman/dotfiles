# Configure autocompletion to be:
# - case-insensitive,
# - prompt to show all if there are more than 200 possible matches,
# - prevent expansion of "~" to the home directory when completing, though the actual value passed on to the command is still expanded,
# - add a trailing slash for matches that are symlinked directories,
# - disable matching hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot,
# - show all matches at once,
# - improve matching by looking at the text after the cursor (e.g. when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and the cursor is on the "z", tabbing will not autocomplete it to "cd ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla")
# - display extra file information (like `ls -F`) for matches
# - enable flipping through matches with Shift-Tab
